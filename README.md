# HistoryAIToolkit

AI toolkit for professional and amateur historians, and for anyone who wishes to contribute to the recording of history by and for the community.

## Status

The code in here is a proof-of-concept to give you an idea of what we're building. It doesn't work yet. It will probably all be changed completely.

## Prototype

The scope of the prototype we hope to complete at PyCon UK is:

* [ ] Take interview audio in from main.py
  * [ ] Realtime microphone input
  * [ ] Mock input from a short audio file simulating a piece of an interview
* [ ] Transcribe the interview audio using a (preferably free) transcription package or API
* [ ] Save the transcription to a text file
* [ ] Print the transcription to the console
* [ ] Pass the text to a (preferably free) LLM package or API to generate a list of follow-up interview questions
* [ ] Print the questions to the console

## Example Data

To experiment with this project using a recorded interview for test purposes, download one or more of the audio files from:
