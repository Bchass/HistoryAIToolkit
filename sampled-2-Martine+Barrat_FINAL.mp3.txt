 My name is Sylvie Camd√©e. Today is February 6, 2015, and I will have a conversation with Martin Barra at her place in Chelsea. Martin, good evening. We know each other, we started a conversation, but could you please tell us about yourself to begin? It's very difficult to work and I start. When I arrived in New York or before I arrived in New York, I was a dancer, modern dance, and I was dancing in the festival in Edinburgh, an international festival of dance. And one beautiful black woman, so me dancing, and she said, girl, one day I'm going to send you a ticket. That was in 1966, and in June, 1968, 18, I opened an envelope and I found my ticket. That's how it started. So I arrived in New York after fighting crazy for the revolution in Paris. I was very, very active and very happy, thinking the world would change and France would change. And I love New York so much, I was staying at her place for a while. I love New York so much that I stayed there and I never left. But in the 17th New York was extraordinary. It was incredible. Music, poetry, nobody would think about money. We would think about doing, expressing ourselves, doing beautiful things. That was the time of all the great musicians like Annette Coleman and so many other ones. Oh my God. And for a long time I was a bar maid in a jazz house.
